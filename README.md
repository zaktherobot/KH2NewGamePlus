# KH2NewGamePlus
Start KH2 with all abilities and max stats

PLEASE DONT DM ME TO DEBUG YOUR MOD SETUP! This was meant to be a one off mod for one person, I don't want to maintain this if it breaks.

## How to use
1) Set up OpenKH with LuaBackend (a guide for rando can be found here: https://kh2rando.com/setup/Panacea-ModLoader/ and you can stop at the installing LuaBackend step)
2) Install this mod in openkh. 
3) Note: Recommended to use the gummi skip mod with this due to some issues with the default usage of openkh.
